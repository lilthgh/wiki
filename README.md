### Project Aims:
Wiki project, where I've created a web-based encyclopedia inspired by Wikipedia using Django, HTML, CSS, and Python.
In this project, users can explore a collection of entries. Each entry is conveniently listed on the main page, and by clicking on any entry name, users are taken directly to that specific entry page.
### Technologies:

* Back-end:
  * Python
  * Django

* Front-end:
  * HTML (with Django templating)
  * CSS (with some Bootstrap Components)
### Project Requirements:
1.Entry Page: we can Visit /wiki/TITLE
If the entry does not exist, it renders an error page. If it exists, it displays the entry in entry.html with the title and content.
2.index page
all pages in the encyclopedia, user can click on any entry name to be taken directly to that entry page.
3.search(request):
Processes search requests when submitted via POST.
It checks if the searched entry exists. If so, it displays the entry; if not, it recommends similar entries based on the search term.
Recommendations are generated by case-insensitive matches of the search term in the list of all entries.
4.creat a new_page(request):
Facilitates the creation of a new entry.
Handles the GET request to render a form for creating new entries and the POST request to process the form submission.
Checks for duplicate titles. If the title exists, it renders an error. If not, it saves the new entry and redirects to that entry.
5.edit(request):
Enables editing of an existing entry.
Renders an edit form prepopulated with the content of the entry to be edited.
6.save_edit(request):
Handles the submission of the edited entry.
Saves the updated entry and then renders the updated entry page.
7.rand(request):
Redirects users to a random encyclopedia entry.
Renders the random entry page.
